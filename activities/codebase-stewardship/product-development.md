# Codebase Product Development

## Product life cycle

A [product](../../glossary/product-definition.md) starts with an idea which reflects a need or provides a solution to specific problem. In the context of public code the indented product often supports the management and or execution of public policy.

The process from and initial idea to a fully developed product is an evolutionary process supported by a variety of development methodologies and management frameworks (see further reading). A product is constantly refined, altered and improved. This entire process is often referred to as the product life cycle.

The product life cycle can be described from different perspectives. From an economic perspective such as the [Product Life Cycle Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_life-cycle_theory) or from a [product engineering perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle). Designing, developing and managing a product is a multi-disciplinary activity which touches all types of activities in an organization ranging from marketing to business development to customer support.

From a high-level overview the product life cycle could be divided in the following phases:

* Phase 1: Conceive - Imagine, specify, plan, innovate
* Phase 2: Design - Describe, define, develop, test, analyze and validate
* Phase 3: Realize - Manufacture, make, build, procure, produce, sell and deliver
* Phase 4: Service - Use, operate, maintain, support, sustain, phase-out, retire
* All phases - Communicate, manage and collaborate

It is imported to note that none of the above phases should be considered as isolated. In reality, a product life cycle does not run sequentially or separated from other product development activities, with information flowing between different people and systems. These phases are constantly revisited and revised during the lifespan of a product. Software development using agile frameworks where these kind of phases are executed iteratively and in parallel.

## Product stewardship activities in the product life cycle

In the context of codebase stewardship the goal of product stewardship is to support codebases and their communities. This helps them build and grow a viable and sustainable ecosystem around a codebase, Then a community can use shared resources and knowledge to support the product life cycle for the duration for its lifespan.

As codebase stewards we work with different levels of codebases that implement products which differ in product maturity. Codebases which started out being developed and used in a single organization have different needs and dynamics than codebases used by a variety of organizations and or functional contexts.

When a codebase is being replicated or used by more than one organization a community faces the following challenges in order to support the product life cycle.

How does a community:

* Decide which features are being developed?
* Prioritize and estimate features needed?
* Finance and organize the development needed to be done?
* Share and community with each other and there stakeholders?
* Handle conflict of interest?

All these challenges are related to how a community govern its codebase and community. As codebase stewards we help communities explore and answer these question by supporting and coaching them in the different phases of the product life cycle.

Below is a mapping between the product life cycle phases and how product stewardship can support these phases.

### Phase 1: Conceive

The first stage is the definition of the product requirements based on customer, company, market and regulatory bodiesâ€™ viewpoints. From this specification, the product's major functional and technical parameters can be defined.

For a codebase steward it is unlikely to be involved in conceiving the first iteration of phase 1. A codebase is usually an implementation of a product therefore mostly there already has been an iteration of phase 1.

However it might be that the goal or use of a product is unclear or needs refinement and further specification. This is usually the case when a product is used by more organizations and or when public policy, law or regulations change.

Codebase stewards can support this phase by helping a community to develop a product manifest or product description clarifying what the purpose and goal of a codebase implementing a product is, what problem(s) it solves and what value it provides towards its users.

### Phase 2: Design

This is where the detailed design and development of the product's form starts, progressing to prototype testing, through pilot release to full product launch. It can also involve redesign and ramp for improvement to existing products as well as planned obsolescence.

For a codebase steward it is unlikely to be involved in the first iteration of phase 2. A codebase is usually an implementation of a product therefore mostly there already has been an iteration of phase 2.

Typically the design of the product is done by the stakeholders and developers of the community themselves. However, before something will be designed there needs to be discussion about why and how something should be designed and before it can be realized there also need to be commitment to resources (developer capacity).

Codebase stewards can support this phase by helping a community to take product accessibility into account using the design. In the context of public code, public organizations or governments might have accessibility guidelines or policies which take into account that all people must be able to use the product, even if their vision, hearing or mobility is impaired. Also the interaction with the product should be inclusive towards all people. The Standard for Public code includes requirements which support inclusive use and development.

Furthermore the design of a product needs refinement, more planning or alteration. This is typically the case for products which will be used by more organizations or will be used in other contexts than the product's original intended use. More organizations means more stakeholders, which makes designing the product and deciding what to realize more challenging.

Codebase stewards can support this phase by helping the community to adopt a process and method which helps them to discuss, describe and prioritize on product features.

### Phase 3: Realize

Activities in this phase are related to manufacturing, making, building, procuring, producing, selling, and delivering the product.

The actual development is done by developers which might be a combination of in-house developers and procured software vendors. In larger codebases this might involve multiple vendors and procurement.

A codebase steward might be involved in supporting the development process from a quality perspective. The Standard for Public Code includes a number of criteria and requirements which helps developers with the actual development process. Codebase quality, code reviews, continuous integration and deployment

From a product management perspective codebase stewards can support this phase by helping the community to adopt a process and method which helps them to discuss, describe and prioritize on product features. (see all phases)

### Phase 4: Service

The activities in this phase are related to using, operating, maintaining, supporting, sustaining, phasing out, and retiring a product.

The final phase of the life cycle involves managing "in-service" information. This can include providing customers and service engineers with the support and information required for support repair and maintenance. This can involve the use of tools such as hosting, maintenance, user training and support.

Typically these services can be provided in-house by large public organization or by procuring a software vendor who takes care of the operational aspect of the product. In the context of open source it could also be a vendor seeing the opportunity to use an entire codebase and develop a product as a service and contribute to the the open source codebase itself.

A codebase steward can support this phase by organizing a workshop to support the community to explore business models and financing. Such a workshop may provide inside on how further procurement and development can be funded and to include software vendors into the community to help provide and sell services around a product whilst collaborating in the open with other stakeholders.

Codebase stewards can also support this phase by organizing a Hosting and Service Level Agreement workshop to help a codebase community to explore how to collaboratively procure hosting services and define a level of support for end users using the product in their daily work.

### All phases: product life cycle

Communicate, manage and collaborate. This phase is to reiterate the above phases are not single isolated activities. During the life cycle of a product it is important to have established an ongoing iterative process which allows all stakeholders of a codebase to improve the product.

Codebase stewards can support all phases by helping the community to adopt a process and method which helps them to discuss, describe and prioritize on product features. This process is an integral and recurring process which is referred to as (shared) product management. Being able to execute shared product management involves defining the product management aspect of the governance of a codebase and affects all life cycle phases for the duration of the product's lifespan (see All phases). This process can be supported by conducting workshops on product management and helping the community define an open and shared product backlog.
