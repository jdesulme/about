# Communication principles

The Foundation For Public Code itself is open source.

Our communication principles are:

* open, unless: open by default, unless you can explain why it needs to be closed
* invites contributions by all
* clearly explained
* hypertextual, web first
* interactive
* publishable

These communication principles build on and extend our [cultural values](../../organization/cultural-values.md).
