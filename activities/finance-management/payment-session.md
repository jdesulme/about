# Payment session

On a regular basis we'd like to pay all bills and things we need to.

This session is meant to get all of those tasks done.

Tasks:

1. Make payment orders for:
   * Outstanding invoices that were sent to the [invoices email group](https://groups.google.com/a/publiccode.net/g/invoices).
   * Payment orders for the [salaries `SEPA` file and the wage taxes](../staff-management/salary-administration.md).
1. Send the payment orders, and if required ask someone with signing permissions to sign them.
