# Partnerships

The Foundation for Public Code is a member-owned association that exists in an ecosystem of partners and [affiliates](affiliates.md). Our partners are integral to our ability to [achieve our mission](https://about.publiccode.net/organization/mission.html). Read more about [becoming a partner](../activities/creating-partnerships/index.md).

We currently have no partners.
