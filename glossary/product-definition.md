# Product

A product is an object or system made available for consumer use that can be offered to a market to satisfy the desire or need of a customer. A product can be classified as tangible or intangible. A tangible product is a physical object that can be perceived by touch such as a building, vehicle, gadget, or clothing. An intangible product is a product that can only be perceived indirectly such as an insurance policy. Services can be broadly classified under intangible products which can be durable or non durable.

In the context of the Foundation's for Public Code work we define a product as a re-implementable set of public code, packaged with documentation ready for re-use. We support products over projects to acknowledge that code is not something you make and then abandon - it is not just about planning and control. It is about innovation and maintenance with a focus on product availability, accessibility and re-usability.
